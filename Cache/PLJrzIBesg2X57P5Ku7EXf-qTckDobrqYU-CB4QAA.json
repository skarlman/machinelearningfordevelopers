This session will go over the various ways and solutions available to infuse AI into your existing .NET apps across connected and edge scenarios. This session will show you the multiple ways you can implement AI features on .NET apps, starting from a the easiest implementations (Cognitive Services in Azure and Azure ML) but also moving forward to more advanced and flexible scenarios based on the latest tools like Azure Workbench and the most important libraries like TensorFlow, CNTK and other AI approaches just being released to work with .NET like Tensor T. Lastly,  the session will also highlight some of the work that the .NET team is investing in to make AI an integral part of .NET!\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/azft-ml",

OUR OPINIONS.\n\nJoin Zeeshan Siddiqui talk about all the exciting work which has been going into the open source ML.NET library. They just had a release (1.2.0!). The team are presenting a paper in KDD this August which talks about some of the impressive technical achievements in ML.NET. Zeeshan is going to talk us through this paper step by step.\n\nSome of the headline talking points are how we can achieve 3 orders of magnitude improvement in training time with ML.NET compared to SK-learn! \n\nThere is a lazily evaluated, parallelised data processing system built in, allowing processing of terabytes of data without using much memory on the machine. There is also some exciting work now in ML.NET around interpretability, portable/heterogeneous ML and automated ML. \n\nMachine learning is becoming a data and software engineering discipline and the ML.NET team are making great strides in this direction to empower all of us get models into production, and increase the quality, robustness and velocity of ML model deployments. \n\nHere is the link to the paper;\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05715.pdf \n\nPart 1 of our interview with Zeeshan at ICML is up on our YouTube channel too.\n\nML.NET is a cross-platform open-source machine learning framework which makes machine learning accessible to .NET developers.\n\nML.NET allows .NET developers to develop their own models and infuse custom machine learning into their applications, using .NET, even without prior expertise in developing or tuning machine learning models.\n\nML.NET was originally developed in Microsoft Research, and evolved into a significant framework over the last decade and is used across many product groups in Microsoft like Windows, Bing, PowerPoint, Excel and more.\n\nML.NET enables machine learning tasks like classification (for example: support text classification, sentiment analysis) and regression (for example, price-prediction).\n\nAlong with these ML capabilities, this first release of ML.NET also brings the first draft of .NET APIs for training models, using models for predictions, as well as the core components of this framework such as learning algorithms, transforms, and ML data structures.\n\nhttps://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet\nNimbusML: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nimbusml/overview\nAutoML: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/how-to-use-the-automl-api\n\nCOMPLIANCE NOTICE:\n* THIS WAS FILMED WHILE I WORKED AT MICROSOFT, NOW I DON'T\n* EVERYONE IN THIS VIDEO HAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO APPEAR IN THE VIDEO\n* NO MICROSOFT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WAS DISCUSSED\n* WE ARE DISCUSSING PUBLIC LITERATURE\n* THESE ARE OUR PERSONAL OPINIONS\n* I REFERRED TO THE CHANNEL AS \"MACHINE LEARNING AT MICROSOFT\", IT HAS NOW BEEN RENAMED \"MACHINE LEARNING DOJO\" TO MAKE IT CLEAR IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL MICROSOFT CHANNEL\n* THIS WAS FILMED IN 2019 IN OUR PERSONAL TIME\n* THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN CHECKED AND VALIDATED BY THE ML.NET TEAM FOR POTENTIAL DISCLOSURES\n* WE REFER TO ML.NET PREVIOUSLY BEING CODE-NAMED \"TLC\", THIS IS NOT A CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE, THIS INFO IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN; https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2017/01/13/using-the-microsoft-tlc-machine-learning-tool/ and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/connect/machine-learning-ml-net-the-machine-learning-framework-for-net-developers",
